       "As of May 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Operator**: Launched in January 2025, OpenAI Operator autonomously performs web-based tasks such as form filling, online orders, and scheduling. It utilizes advanced models to automate daily activities, though it currently requires user intervention for complex interfaces and has faced reliability challenges under high demand. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Operator?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Eliza**: Introduced in January 2025, Eliza is an open-source, Web3-friendly AI agent framework. It integrates seamlessly with blockchain applications, allowing users to deploy decentralized applications effortlessly. Eliza emphasizes user control, with all components being regular TypeScript programs. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoAgent**: Released in February 2025, AutoAgent is a fully automated, zero-code framework for Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It enables users to create and deploy LLM agents using natural language, featuring an autonomous agent operating system with components like an actionable engine and self-managing file system. AutoAgent has demonstrated superior performance in generalist multi-agent tasks. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AgentLite**: Launched in February 2024, AgentLite is a lightweight library designed for building and advancing task-oriented LLM agent systems. It simplifies the development of new reasoning strategies and agent architectures, facilitating the creation of multi-agent systems. AgentLite has been used to develop practical applications, showcasing its convenience and flexibility. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15538?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **RAI**: Introduced in May 2025, RAI is a flexible agent framework for embodied AI, integrating with robotic stacks, LLMs, and simulations. It offers out-of-the-box integration with systems like ROS 2 and provides mechanisms for agent embodiment, tested on physical robots and simulations. RAI has been successfully used to build multi-agent systems, demonstrating effectiveness in various tasks. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07532?utm_source=openai))\n",
